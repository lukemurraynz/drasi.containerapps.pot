# Contributing to the Trading Demo

This document contains suggestions for improving the Trading Demo and exercises to help you learn Drasi by contributing.

Whether you're learning Drasi or looking to contribute to the project, these ideas range from beginner-friendly enhancements to more advanced features.

## Learning Exercises

These exercises are designed to help you understand Drasi by making small, focused changes to the trading demo.

### Beginner

#### Exercise 1: Add a New Stock to the Watchlist

**Goal**: Understand how queries filter data.

1. Open `app/src/services/DrasiClient.ts`
2. Find the `watchlist-query` definition
3. Add `'AMZN'` to the `WHERE s.symbol IN [...]` clause
4. Restart the app and observe the new stock appear

**What you'll learn**: How Cypher WHERE clauses filter continuous query results.

#### Exercise 2: Change the High Volume Threshold

**Goal**: Understand query conditions and result set changes.

1. Find `high-volume-query` in `DrasiClient.ts`
2. Change `sp.volume > 10000000` to `sp.volume > 5000000`
3. Watch how more stocks now qualify for the "High Volume" panel

**What you'll learn**: How changing query conditions affects which rows enter/exit result sets.

#### Exercise 3: Add a New Field to the Ticker

**Goal**: Understand query RETURN clauses.

1. Find `price-ticker-query` in `DrasiClient.ts`
2. Add `sp.volume AS volume` to the RETURN clause
3. Update `StockTicker.tsx` to display the volume

**What you'll learn**: How to extend query results with additional fields.

### Intermediate

#### Exercise 4: Create a Sector Filter Query

**Goal**: Build a new query from scratch.

Create a query that shows only Technology stocks:

```typescript
this.queries.set('tech-stocks-query', {
  id: 'tech-stocks-query',
  query: `
    MATCH (s:stocks)-[:HAS_PRICE]->(sp:stock_prices)
    WHERE s.sector = 'Technology'
    RETURN s.symbol AS symbol,
           s.name AS name,
           sp.price AS price,
           ((sp.price - sp.previous_close) / sp.previous_close * 100) AS change_percent
  `,
  sources: [
    { sourceId: 'postgres-stocks', pipeline: [] },
    { sourceId: 'price-feed', pipeline: [] }
  ],
  joins: [hasPrice]
});
```

Then create a new UI panel to display it.

**What you'll learn**: The full cycle of creating queries and connecting them to UI components.

#### Exercise 5: Implement a Price Alert

**Goal**: Understand ADD and DELETE events in continuous queries.

Create a query that returns stocks crossing a price threshold:

```typescript
// Stocks that just crossed above $200
MATCH (s:stocks)-[:HAS_PRICE]->(sp:stock_prices)
WHERE sp.price > 200 AND sp.previous_close <= 200
RETURN s.symbol, sp.price
```

**What you'll learn**: How rows enter (ADD) and exit (DELETE) query result sets based on conditions.

#### Exercise 6: Add Database Write Buttons

**Goal**: Understand PostgreSQL CDC and how database changes trigger query updates.

Add "Buy" and "Sell" buttons to the Portfolio panel:

1. Create an API endpoint or direct database connection
2. INSERT into the `portfolio` table when buying
3. DELETE from the `portfolio` table when selling
4. Watch the portfolio-query update automatically via CDC

**What you'll learn**: How PostgreSQL logical replication captures changes and feeds them to Drasi.

### Advanced

#### Exercise 7: Create a Query Inspector Panel

**Goal**: Deep understanding of SSE events and query result changes.

Build a developer panel that shows:

- Raw SSE events as they arrive
- Event types (ADD/UPDATE/DELETE) with visual indicators
- Which queries are firing and when
- Latency from price change to UI update

**What you'll learn**: The internal mechanics of how Drasi delivers change notifications.

#### Exercise 8: Implement Query Parameters

**Goal**: Understand dynamic query modification.

Allow users to change query parameters at runtime:

1. Add a form to set the watchlist symbols
2. Recreate the query with new parameters
3. Handle the transition smoothly in the UI

**What you'll learn**: Query lifecycle management and dynamic query creation.

#### Exercise 9: Add a Second Reaction Type

**Goal**: Understand Drasi's reaction system.

Add a webhook reaction alongside SSE:

1. Create an HTTP reaction that POSTs to a local endpoint
2. Build a simple server to receive the webhooks
3. Compare the data format between SSE and HTTP reactions

**What you'll learn**: How different reaction types serve different use cases.

## Feature Contributions

These are more substantial features that would improve the demo for everyone.

### High Priority

## Documentation Contributions

### Improve Inline Code Comments

Add JSDoc comments explaining key concepts:

```typescript
/**
 * Synthetic joins define relationships that don't exist in the database.
 * This HAS_PRICE join connects stocks (PostgreSQL) to prices (HTTP source)
 * by matching on the 'symbol' property in both node types.
 *
 * When Drasi sees a stock with symbol='AAPL' and a price with symbol='AAPL',
 * it creates a virtual HAS_PRICE edge between them.
 */
const hasPrice: QueryJoin = {
  id: 'HAS_PRICE',
  keys: [
    { label: 'stocks', property: 'symbol' },
    { label: 'stock_prices', property: 'symbol' }
  ]
};
```
